ECOP01 - ALGORITHMS (2021)

- Memory Game: A small, 2-player, memory game with letters of the alphabet. 

- Owl Simulator: Controls an owl population in the dephts of a cavern. All with bat enemies and berries as food. 
You may collect resources to build nests, breed babies in those nests and feed them berries to turn them into adult owls.

ECOP02 - DATA STRUCTURES (2021)

- Freecell: A more robust, ms-dos like, single player card-game. Your goal is to organize in ascending numbers and pile up the cards by their suits on the suits piles. Some rules of the game will stand as challanges against your goal.
