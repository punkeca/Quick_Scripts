# Quick Scripts
Small projects developed during my Computer Engineering Major at UNIFEI.

INDEPENDENT (2021 - 2025)

- Navy Battle: Single player, sink all your enemy ships to win the game. Beware! Bombs are limited.
- Morse Encoder-Decoder: Type an english message, get a morse equivalent. (Will be expanded to allow for choices of encoding or decoding your input).

ECOP01 - ALGORITHMS (2021)

- Memory Game: A small, 2-player, memory game with letters of the alphabet. 

- Owl Simulator: Controls an owl population in the dephts of a cavern. All with bat enemies and berries as food. 
You may collect resources to build nests, breed babies in those nests and feed them berries to turn them into adult owls.

ECOP02 - DATA STRUCTURES (2021)

- Freecell: A more robust, ms-dos like, single player card-game. Your goal is to organize the cards in ascending numbers and pile them up by their suits on the suits piles. Some rules of the game will stand as challanges against your goal.


ECOP04 - EMBEDDED SYSTEMS (2021)

- Exploding Safe: The PQDB will work to simulate a safe - if you get your password wrong 3 times you'll face eminent explosion! 

ECOM11A - DISCREET MATH LAB (2022)

- Record Database: A records database implemented in Haskell, using all the power of a functional programming language. Include and erase discs, research with varying methods or display your database organized by age.

ECOM03A - GRAPH THEORY (2022)
- ComarcasMG: Python script that calculates distance between some districts of Minas Gerais and finds the MST, thus finding the shortest path to reach all destinations. This can be used to spare resources when building a network of some kind.
